<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective Date: February 18, 2026</p>

<p>VeloxRead ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p><span class="highlight">We do not collect any personal data.</span></p>
<p>VeloxRead is designed to work entirely offline on your device. The App does not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Collect, transmit, or store any personal information</li>
    <li>Track your location</li>
    <li>Use analytics or tracking frameworks</li>
    <li>Contain advertising SDKs</li>
    <li>Require an account or login</li>
    <li>Connect to the internet for any purpose</li>
</ul>

<h2>PDF Documents</h2>
<p>PDF files you import into VeloxRead are processed entirely on your device. The text content is extracted locally for the purpose of displaying words during your reading session. Your documents are never uploaded, shared, or transmitted to any server.</p>

<h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
<p>VeloxRead stores a small amount of data locally on your device using standard iOS storage (UserDefaults):</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reading position bookmark:</strong> The file name, word index, and reading speed of your most recent session, so you can resume where you left off.</li>
</ul>
<p>This data remains on your device and is not accessible to us or any third party. You can clear this data at any time by deleting the App.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>VeloxRead does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>VeloxRead does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The App is suitable for all ages as rated 4+ on the App Store.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Because VeloxRead does not collect or transmit any data, there is no risk of data breach or unauthorized access to your information through the App.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
